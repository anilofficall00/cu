# Version 3.0 Moderation Changes

Reasons:

- Are now optional! If you do not wish to set one immediately, you can leave it blank, and set it later!

- If the reason was left blank, it must be set to something new within 100 messages in the mod log, otherwise it     won't be able to go back and set the reason. This may be buffed in the future.

Unban Command:

- It exists now!

- Reason is mandatory, I'll be fixing that :soontm:
